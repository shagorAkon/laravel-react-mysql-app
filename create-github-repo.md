# How to Push This Project to Your GitHub

Since the repository doesn't exist yet, here are the steps to create it and push your code:

## Method 1: Create Repository via GitHub Website (Easiest)

1. **Go to GitHub**: Visit https://github.com/shagorAkon
2. **Create New Repository**: Click the green "New" button
3. **Repository Settings**:
   - Repository name: `laravel-react-mysql-app`
   - Description: `Laravel + React.js application with MySQL database`
   - Make it **Public**
   - **DO NOT** check "Add a README file" (we already have one)
   - **DO NOT** check "Add .gitignore" (we already have one)
   - **DO NOT** check "Choose a license" (optional)
4. **Click "Create repository"**

## Method 2: After Creating the Repository

Once you've created the repository on GitHub, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "F:\AI PROJECT\laravel-react-app"

# Add the GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/shagorAkon/laravel-react-mysql-app.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Method 3: Alternative Repository Names

If `laravel-react-mysql-app` is taken, try these names:
- `laravel-react-project-2024`
- `fullstack-laravel-react`
- `laravel-react-webapp`
- `my-laravel-react-app`
